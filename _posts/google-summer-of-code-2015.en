<!--:en-->We had an extremely successful summer - and a big part of this are the contributions of our four students that were part of the Google Summer of Code 2015.

Four very interesting projects were accepted and the results of their work will be integrated into the upcoming Subsurface 4.5 release:
<ul>
	<li>Claudiu implemented Bluetooth support in Subsurface and a mechanism to integrate this into libdivecomputer which greatly improves the user experience for divers with Bluetooth enabled dive computers like the heinrichs weikamp OSTC (thanks to <a href="http://heinrichsweikamp.com/">heinrichs weikamp</a> for supporting this project by providing free equipment to Claudiu so he could successfully test his code)

	<li>Gehad worked on a new printing subsystem that allows user customizable templates

	<li>Grace implemented a mobile UI for Subsurface that will allow us to have a full featured Subsurface app on Android</li>
	<li>Jan implemented VPM-B for our dive planner so we now have two different deco algorithms available for dive planning</li>
</ul>
