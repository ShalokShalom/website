The Subsurface development team proudly announces release 4.4 of Subsurface, an open source divelog and dive planning program for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and a number of Linux flavors (Ubuntu, Debian Jessie, Linux Mint, Fedora, and openSUSE). Please take a look at our <a title="Downloads" href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/download/">Downloads</a> page for details.

There is also a new interactive dialog that makes it much easier to identify the meaning of various columns in CSV import.

<em>Subsurface</em> profile drawing has been sped up significantly which also improved the situation when using the visual editor to add dives or plan dives.
