<!--:en--><p>With very few issues found in the Beta we are going straight from Beta 1 to a Release Candidate. Binaries are on the server for <a title="64 bit Windows" href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/downloads/subsurface-4.3-RC.exe">64 bit Windows</a> and <a title="32 bit Windows" href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/downloads/subsurface-4.3-RC-32bit-Qt4.exe">32 bit Windows</a> and <a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/downloads/Subsurface-4.3-RC.dmg">Mac</a> as well.</p>
<p>The 4.3-RC of Subsurface identifies itself as 4.2.91 - yes, this does make sense. Trust me.</p><!--:-->
