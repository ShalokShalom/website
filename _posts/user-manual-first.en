<p>Thanks to Jacco van Koll over the last few weeks we have made tremendous progress towards a user manual. And I spent much of yesterday to convert that into docbook and put the tooling in place to easily keep a version on this website in sync with the documenation in the git tree. Special thanks to Remko Tron√ßon for his <a href="http://el-tramo.be/blog/integrating-docbook-with-wordpress/">docbook-kit</a> that made all this really easy.</p>
<p>Please take a look and provide feedback: <a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/user-manual">User Manual</a>.</p>
