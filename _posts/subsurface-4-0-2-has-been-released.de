The Subsurface team is proud to announce another small bugfix and enhancement update to Subsurface.

New in version 4.0.2 compared to Subsurface 4.0.1:
<ul>
	<li>fixed potential crash when importing dive data without dive computer model information</li>
	<li>improve parsing of equipment data; this now accepts localized units as well as input in units that are not the display units (so if you run Subsurface in metric, but went diving in a place where weights are in US Pounds (lbs), you can now enter the weight in lbs and Subsurface does the right thing)</li>
	<li>fix temperature conversion when downloading data from Uemis SDA</li>
	<li>improve autocompletion to always be case insensitive</li>
	<li>improve selection handling in the dive list</li>
	<li>include event data in libdivecomputer dump</li>
	<li>improve profiles generated for dives with no depth samples and no average depth</li>
</ul>
